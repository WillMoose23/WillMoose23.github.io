    <h1>RTX 4090 Benchmark and Applications</h1>
	
    <p>The <strong>RTX 4090</strong> is an absolute <strong>beast</strong> of a GPU. It has 16834 CUDA Cores with 24GB of RAM. I'm interested in purchasing this GPU because I want to keep playing video games post college and use it for <strong>machine learning</strong> applications. Benchmark wise, this device can achieve a 71% improvement over the <strong>RTX 3090</strong> in most applications which makes it better value for the money.</p>
